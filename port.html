        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3>Automation Skills</h3>
        <p> Email to WhatsApp Integration <br>
            I have successfully set up an automation that connects my email with my WhatsApp. 
            This integration ensures that any email I receive is automatically forwarded to my WhatsApp, 
            allowing me to stay informed and respond 
            promptly, no matter where I am. This system enhances my efficiency and ensures seamless communication.</p>
            <h3>Lead Generation Automation for E-commerce Business</h3>
<P>I designed and implemented an automated lead generation system for an e-commerce client using Zapier and various CRM tools. This project involved creating workflows that automatically captured leads from web forms and social media platforms, which were then segmented and nurtured through targeted email campaigns. As a result, the client experienced a 30% increase in lead conversion rates within three months.
</P>
<h3>Customer Support Workflow Automation</h3>
<P>I developed an automated support ticketing system that integrated Slack and email notifications for a tech startup. Using Zapier, I configured it to automatically create tickets in a helpdesk tool whenever a customer emailed support. Furthermore, automated updates were sent to the support team via Slack, significantly reducing response times and improving overall customer satisfaction ratings by 25%.
</P>
<h3>Appointment Scheduling Automation</h3>
<P>I implemented a comprehensive appointment scheduling solution for a consulting firm, automating the entire process from initial outreach to confirmation. By utilizing Zapier, I connected their email service with a calendar application, enabling automatic scheduling and reminders for both clients and staff. This project streamlined 
    the scheduling process, reducing the administrative workload by 40% and ensuring that appointments were never missed.
